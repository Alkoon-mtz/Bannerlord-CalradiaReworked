# About this Mod
This mod is a basic overhaul for bannerlord.  
It rework all the existing assets with new cultures, kingdoms, lords, clans, wanderers, troop trees and more.  
It also provide a new character creation menu, an easy way of handling starting position and a neutral faction.  
Do not use this in story mod since all the native lords has been removed, you couldn't finish the quest.  

## Warnings
This mod is not mean to be historicaly or lore accurate, i just wanted to add more kingdoms and a bit of specialization in troops.  
The map used for this mod have a few bugs, while i corrected some minor one, i can't correct all of them.  
I'm using this map because it is large enough to handle 11 factions, and the europe map, while absolutly beautiful is too historicaly connoted.  

You can use this mod files to make your own i don't care, just don't sell it, modding must be free and open source.

## Features
### Cultures
Beside reworking the 6 existing cultures, this mod adds 5 more.  
All cultures troop trees have  
* a strong specialized noble unit(T3-T6)
* an elite specialized unit(T5 max)
* an elite polyvalent unit(T5 max)

All cultures have their own kingdom, with completely new lords, banners, outlaws.  
They can hire one the 4 new mercenary clans or just hire their troops in the tavern.  

There is also a neutral kingdom, the explorers, where you can find a bit of peace...or join and make it a powerful kingdom.  

## Compatibility
This mod is NOT save game compatible since it changes a lot of things, you need to make a new game in sandbox mod to play it.  
It will not work with other overhaul mods.
